# Few Shot Learning Complete Intersection Calabi Yau manifolds using Siamese Neural Networks

This is a repository of codes for and around our work in [arXiv:2111.04761](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04761)

In this paper we apply Siamese Neural Networks to infer topological numbers of complete intersection Calabi-Yau manifolds.
