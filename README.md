# Few Shot Learning Complete Intersection Calabi Yau manifolds using Siamese Neural Networks

This is a repository of codes for and around our work in [arXiv:2111.04761](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04761)

In this paper we apply Siamese Neural Networks to learn a similarity score for Complete Intersection Calabi Yau manifolds of complex
dimension 3. This dataset is known as CICY3 in the literature, and is downloadable [here](http://www-thphys.physics.ox.ac.uk/projects/CalabiYau/cicylist/).

These are a class of manifolds which are of great relevance when building models that contain the physics of our four dimensional universe.

In addition, they are perhaps the first dataset created for Algebraic Geometry and String Theory.
