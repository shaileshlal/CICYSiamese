# Clustering Analyses for the CICY Configuration Matrices
We use K means clustering and K nearest neighbors classification to infer the map between CICY configuration matrices
and the Hodge number _h<sup>1,1</sup> before passing the matrices through the Siamese Network. 

This is mostly illustrative and for comparison with the Siamese Network analysis in the notebooks [here](../SiameseClustering)
