# Statistics of the CICY3 Dataset

This is an overview of some statistical properties of the CICY3 dataset, focusing mostly
on its demographics. We see that the dataset is highly skewed, with the least populous class 
having only one element, and the most populated class having approximately 1400. 

This skewness is characteristic to datasets in this field, as detailed 
[here](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14442).

We will also outline some interesting correlations between input data and target variables.
